1. It took about 10 hours 
2. Certain parts were more difficult than others. I had to plan out the dimensions of the table before hand and go through a little trial and error to get the right size of rectangles so that everything would fit. My tuples contained (int,int,float,string). I had difficulties drawing the string on the rectangles and had to explicitly cast it from string to a Text for it to print. This end up causing issues when I was calling the tuples for the new input grams window. I wanted to print out the name of the element but by casting it to a Text object defining a new variable that explicitly cast the name back to a String would cause the entire draw Text string method (Text(Pointâ€¦)) to print rather than just the element name. I had to refer to the element with a new variable when I was calling it via the get method in the for loop that followed the while loop. I also had some difficulties figuring out how to set the syntax for the Entry methods (setText and getText). Also after using a while loop to repeat the input grams action, I had a hard time figuring out how to get actions on the main element window to carry out without having to double click. I'm assuming because my conditions in the while loop and for condition were the getChoice methods to for an element. I wasn't really sure of another way to do this. Also I wash't sure how to carryout getting a new element without having to keep closing and reopening the input grams window. 
3. Not really. As I started I realized what I needed to do and tried to work it out in pieces.
